This video demonstrates training a custom YOLOv11 object detection model using Ultralytics and RoboFlow.  The presenter highlights YOLOv11's speed and accuracy advantages over previous versions, though emphasizing the importance of testing different YOLO models (v5, v8, v10, v11) on your specific dataset. The tutorial uses a helmet detection dataset, showcasing the process from data annotation in RoboFlow, to training in a Google Colab notebook (utilizing a free TPU), and finally, running inference.  The presenter emphasizes the ease and speed of the process, showing how to train a model in minutes using a small dataset.  The video covers model selection, data preparation, training command execution, result interpretation (including mean average precision, precision, and recall), and inference using both command-line and Python code.  Finally, the presenter promotes their additional resources on computer vision and AI career development.
